# Ruby Methods Practice 1!

Welcome back! We're going to jump in to practicing building methods in Ruby. Remember that methods are chunks of code that we name and can call at any time. 

The synax for a method in Ruby is:

```ruby
def method_name(input)
  # code using the input variable
end
```

## Challenges

Create a new Ruby file called 'methods-practice.rb' with the `touch` command in your command line. Open up the file and code the following functions. Make sure to test them out by calling the function and then running `ruby methods-practice.rb` from the command line!

**For each of the methods, you should decide whether you want to *return* the value or simply use *puts* to print something out** 

1. Build a method `timesByOneThousand` that takes an integer and returns the value of it multiplied by 1000. (I started this one for you )

```
def timesByOneThousand(number)
      #code here
    end
```

2. Build a method `howOldIWillBeIn2030` that takes in your age (as an integer) and returns you how old you will be in the year 2030. (16 -> 29)

3. Build a method `makeExcited` that takes a string, makes it all uppercase and adds three exclamation points. ("hello" -> "HELLO!!!")

4. Build a method called `happyBackwards` that takes in a string, reverses it, and then adds on a smiley face character at the end. ("cool" -> "LOOC :)")

5. Build a method called gradeCalculator that takes in a number (0 to 100) and returns the letter grade that corresponds to it. (95 -> "A", 85 -> "B")
